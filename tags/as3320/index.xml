      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since I started the journey of making electronic music some 10 years ago now, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated with how synthesizers and audio equipment work. This turned into the idea of making my own analog synthesizer, which I named &amp;ldquo;The Kiss&amp;rdquo; (I ended up giving it as a gift to my good friend by the nickname Kiss, hence the name). In this article, I will try to describe the design process and the errors I made along the way, which will hopefully serve as an inspiration for other people wanting to create their own analog synthesizer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
